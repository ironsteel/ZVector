ZVector( university project ) - small vector drawing program using Qt for the GUI and OpenGL for drawing
To compile, first obtain the source with git clone, then:
    Linux:
        in the src directory execute:
            $~ qmake
            $~ make
        another way is to open the project in QtCreator
    Windows:
        Not tested yet but should be painless as far as Qt is installed.
